          Over the past several years the McDrew community has opened their
          hearts and checkbooks to support several deserving not-for-profit
          organizations in the Springfield area. We are inspired by friends and
          families who volunteer at these organizations and appreciate the
          innovative efforts of the management teams of these organizations who
          are devoted to serving our community. To date , together, we have
          provided approximately $500,000.00 in financial support to the
          following organizations:
