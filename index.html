                      Toss, Bean Bag, Bean Toss, Soft Horseshoes, Indiana Horseshoes,
                      but to many of us born and raised in Kentucky and the southern
                      part of Ohio, the game is passionately referred to as Cornhole.
                      The truth is, who really knows, but the game is great fun for
                      all ages and can be played anywhere! Scoring can be swift and
                      the lead may change hands several times in a match before the
                      winner is decided. The game is generally played tournament style
                      with an individual or team being named the champion at the end
                      of the tournament.

                <p>
                  Kevin and John organized their initial tennis event in the
                  1st grade at Blessed Sacrament School. In the Spring of
                  1962, along with Tom Jennings and David Humphreville, they
                  put together a grade school doubles tennis team and
                  scheduled matches with Little Flower and St. Al’s. It was
                  Easter Weekend in 1962 when BS met St. Al’s at the Lincoln
                  Park Tennis Court. St. Al’s had a rag tag team with Mike
                  Aiello and John Kulek as their number one doubles team (and
                  only team). McDrew stepped aside in that match and allowed
                  the Jennings/Humphreville team to make short work of
                  Aiello/Kulek. The next month, on Mother’s Day,
                  Jennings/Humphreville were dispatched to take on the Little
                  Flower team of Tim Norris and Greg O’Brien. The
                  Norris/O’Brien team insisted on playing the match on a
                  temporary court constructed on Circle Drive. Didn’t matter.
                  Jennings/Humphreville crushed them. This was the first of
                  many encounters St. Al’s and Little Flower (“Big Weed”)
                  dudes had with the BSS guys and the outcome was always the
                  same. Tennis, basketball, baseball, it did not matter.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Fast forward to the Summer of 1971 and 1972. Kevin and John
                  were working at Oak Ridge Cemetery and had a tendency to get
                  sent home by the foreman for unsubstantiated allegations of
                  misbehavior. Neither could actually “go home” so they went
                  from Oak Ridge to the Lincoln Park Tennis Courts to work on
                  their games for the remainder of the shortened work day.
                  With sharpened tennis skills, they were ready to take the
                  next step and try out for the initial Griffin High School
                  Tennis team in the Spring of 1974. As things turned out,
                  this was the birth of the McDrew.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Details are sketchy at this point but there is no doubt that
                  John Sankey and Dan Kepner had a pivotal role in the
                  creation of the McDrew. At tryouts for the Griffin Team in
                  April of 1974, one shut out Kevin and one shut out Dog. Both
                  Kevin and John appealed their cause with Coach VanDiver but
                  were told to pack up and get out, you guys are done. Well,
                  they were not.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In the early summer of 1974 before John left Springfield for
                  West Point and Kevin for Champaign, the first McDrew was
                  held at Lincoln Greens Tennis Center on Lake Springfield.
                  There were about ten teams entered and no one touched
                  McDrew. The McDrew was born and continues to this day. It
                  has been a wonderful ride.
